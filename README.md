Dynaboard AI Studio is an interactive AI chat system that runs entirely within your Macbook. Powered by local models, use it if you are concerned about privacy implications or vendor lock-in with other web-based models.

All llama.cpp models are supported. Download as little or as many models as you need. We don't make assumptions about your requirements, use your imagination!
